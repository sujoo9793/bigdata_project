Project Title: Correlation Analysis Between Water Quality and Environmental Factors in Major Streams of Seoul

Project Overview:
This study investigates the relationships between water quality parameters (TEMP, pH, DO, TN, TP, TOC) and environmental factors 
(temperature, precipitation, wind speed) in five major streams in Seoul. By employing correlation analysis, visualization techniques, and regression modeling, 
the project aims to uncover insights into how environmental factors influence water quality. 
The findings will provide a data-driven understanding of stream ecosystem dynamics and inform sustainable water resource management strategies.
